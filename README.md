# Uncommon HTML/JavaScript DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to DOM manipulation in JavaScript.  The primary issue lies in how the code attempts to remove a DOM element and subsequently add a new element to a non-existent parent element. This might lead to unexpected behavior or silent errors that are difficult to debug.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `solution.html` file presents the corrected version demonstrating best practices.
